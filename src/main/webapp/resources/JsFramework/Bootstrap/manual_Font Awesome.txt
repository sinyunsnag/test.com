CrossBrowing : Need IE7 Support?
               If you need IE7 support, you have my condolences. Really. Font Awesome 4.2.0 doesn't support IE7, 
               but an older version does. 
               You'll need to check out the 3.2.1 instructions for using IE7. 
               Then go complain to whomever decided your project needs IE7 support.
